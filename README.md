# Welcome to the Zax!

## Description

Zax is a data oriented modern refresh of a compile time language which offers high level language capabilities through to low level memory access. The language does not enforce type or memory safety but can be used in a type safe manner if desired.

## Goals

* Small and performant code input
* Fast and efficient code output
* Data orientated design
* Structural typing system
* Flow control focused
* Full meta programming and reflection
* Prioritization of proven language features
* Long term source compilation stability
* Pay (in terms of cost/efficiency) for what you use
* Build control within the language
* Full compile time code execution

## Non Goals

* Preprocessor
* Enforced memory management
* Enforced safety
* Enforced language feature usage (containing costly runtime overhead)
* Enforced system library usage
* Exceptions
* Garbage collection
* Package manager (source importation is favoured)
* Object oriented modeling
